Hacking on mudata
-----------------
For hacking on the package, it is most convenient to do a so-called development-mode install, which symlinks files in your Python package directory to your mudata working directory, such that you do not need to reinstall after every change. We use `flit <https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ as our build system. After installing flit, you can run ``flit install -s`` from within the mudata project directory to perform a development-mode install. Happy hacking!
